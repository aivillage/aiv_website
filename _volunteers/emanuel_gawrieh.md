Emanuel Gawrieh is a Senior Security Engineer at Google, where he specializes in securing workloads in hybrid, distributed architectures for public sector customers and is part of the Secure AI Framework (SAIF) team advising on hardware and infrastructure security for AI Systems.
 
Emanuel's has spent the better part of a decade working to secure high performance workloads with unique hardware and infrastructure requirements across compliance regimes, and - more recently - has been working with the AI Village to prove out hardware and infrastructure configurations aiming at more efficient infrastructure for model serving, red and purple teaming, and acceleration methods best suited to the context.

Emanuel's research and engineering interests include the intersection of AI Safety and AI Security, AI Systems architecture across deployment patterns, and the imperative to develop more energy efficient approaches to sustaining the workloads for accelerated and distributed compute - including and especially systems running AI/ML workloads (not just LLMs :)) 

Emanuel has a background in public policy.. He attended Georgetown University Law Center in Washington, D.C. after studying Philosophy at Baylor University in Waco, Texas.
