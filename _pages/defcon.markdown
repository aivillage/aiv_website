# Demos

Last year we hosted StableDiffusion a few days before it's release. This year we are returning with more demo stations and opening them to submissions! We will have 2 demo stations equipped with a pair of A6000, and a demo station for remote demos. We'll be hosting ControlNet, Whisper, Alpaca, and notebooks that get into the gory details of these models. 

If you want to present an open source demo that you think the security community should see, please get in touch!

# Prompt Detective

Are you curious about the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT3 and Bloom? Do you want to participate in a unique exercise where you try to get LLMs to misbehave? Join us for Prompt Detective where you'll learn about the technology behind LLMs, their applications, and their current limitations. We will have a few target LLMs set up where you can learn how to perform prompt injection against different levels of [RLHF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning_from_human_feedback). This workshop is open to all individuals, regardless of their background or expertise. It is designed to teach prompt engineering techniques to beginners, and provide a safe target range for people to practice the basics of manipulating the egde cases of this new technology in potentially harmful ways.
