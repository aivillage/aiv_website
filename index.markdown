# About Us

The AI Village is a community of hackers and data scientists working to educate the world on the use and abuse of artificial intelligence in security and privacy. We aim to bring more diverse viewpoints to this field and grow the community of hackers, engineers, researchers, and policy makers working on making the AI we use and create safer. We believe that there needs to be more people with a hacker mindset assessing and analyzing machine learning systems. We have a presence at DEF CON, the worldâ€™s longest running and largest hacking conference.
