AI and ML is already being used to identify job candidates, screen resumes, assess worker productivity and even help tag candidates for firing. Can the interview chatbot AI really be fairer than a human being, and does the way you answer the personality test or your score on the video game assessment really reflect your ability to do the job? Of course, federal, state and local government regulators are concerned, and there are multiple (and potentially conflicting) regulatory efforts underway. 

This conversation, featuring perspectives from a government regulator, civil-rights advocates, and a hacker who’s told a client that their AI is breaking the law, will highlight some of the existing and pending efforts to regulate AI-powered employment tools, and will focus on regulatory, technical and societal solutions to this very-real problem.
