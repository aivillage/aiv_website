Today, models that appear to generate novel outputs conditioned on text are becoming the mainstay of popular culture.
New groups of users are starting to adopt generative architectures and bring new modes (experiential, creative) of interacting with large models.
The understanding of model performance is becoming increasingly qualitative and subjective, as is evident in the latest benchmarks for text-to-image models.

We would like to give a platform to the artists and those building large foundation models to come together, and begin to form a shared understanding of each other's approaches.
## The State of Generative Art

Image generation based on text prompt is no longer stuff of science fiction - you can [experience it for yourself](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dalle-mini/dalle-mini). Instead, new frontiers like photorealism, output resolution, generating images from complex scene descriptions consistent with our understanding of prepositions, and sample-efficient approaches have opened new realms in which large models compete with one another.
Given the nature of the models, the comparisons between their outputs had to acquire a subjective quality.
