# AI Village Art Day @ DEF CON 30
Today, models that appear to generate novel outputs conditioned on text are becoming the mainstay of popular culture.
New groups of users are starting to adopt generative architectures and bring new modes (experiential, creative) of interacting with large models.
The understanding of model performance is becoming increasingly qualitative and subjective, as is evident in the latest benchmarks for text-to-image models.

We would like to give a platform to the artists and those building large foundation models to come together, and begin to form a shared understanding of each other's approaches.
