The AI Village is a community of hackers and data scientists working to educate the world on the use and abuse of artificial intelligence in security and privacy.

We are not sponsored by any one company, and it is our mission to maintain it as such as the community grows.

We have a presence at DEF CON, the world's longest running and largest underground hacking conference.
