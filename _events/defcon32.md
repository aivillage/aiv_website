DEF CON 32 is between August 8-12.

## Demos at DEF CON 32

Join us at the AI Village for interactive demonstrations at the intersection of AI and security. Attempt to hijack and manipulate autonomous robots using large language models and generative AI. Fool your friends by creating deep fakes with a state-of-the-art setup from Bishop Fox, complete with DSLR camera, green screen, and props. Finally, put your social engineering awareness to the test with DARPA’s deep fake analysis system, designed to identify and attribute manipulated and synthetic media. Don’t miss this opportunity to engage with adversarial AI technologies and learn about their implications on the future, at DEF CON 32!

## Generative Red Team 2 at DEF CON 32

At DEF CON 31 AI Village hosted the Generative Red Team (GRT1), the world’s largest, public Large Language Model (LLM) Red Team, in conjunction with other non profit, corporate, and government partners. We brought a taste of model testing to DEF CON and as a first event of its kind much was learned about the models, and about the event. The GRT was a Capture The Flag (CTF) where you found single examples of the model behaving poorly. Hopefully it prepared you for the real thing as this year we’re asking DEF CON for real model evaluations in a “bug” bash.
