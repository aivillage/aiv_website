DEF CON 33 is between August 7-10.

## GRT-3 Announcement

AI red teaming is broken. Currently, small teams run AI evaluations (evals) and slowly make new discoveries. Finding every vulnerability or flaw before release is practically impossible, and security knows this problem well. **The solution is to turn to the crowd.** A large crowd of people working together creatively can do a better job at finding problems than a few experts. We created the Generative Red Team (GRT) to bring people together in order to crowdsource flaws in AI systems. Our efforts to bring new people into the space have been great at getting more people involved, but the findings produced were in formats difficult for vendors to use at-scale. This is critical for any healthy disclosure program, so this year, we are focusing on improving evaluations. **GRT3 will be a hack-a-thon for evaluations**, so come join AI Village at DEFCON 33 to build community and better trust frameworks in AI.
